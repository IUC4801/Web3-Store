# Flipkart Grid 4.0 Submission- Blockchain-based eCommerce warranty system using NFTs

## About The Project

This platform is using NFT as a warranty system of the purchased products. The seller can create an NFT Collection for each retailer\brand that will contain all the warranties of products sold by that retailer\brand as NFTs. The platform mints an NFT to the respective brandâ€™s Collection which will contain all the necessary metadata regarding the purchase like expiry date, order ID, product ID, buyer ID etc. This NFT is minted to the wallet address of the buyer so that the buyer truly owns the warranty and can resale the product if required.
